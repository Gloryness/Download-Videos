## About the Project


A Youtube-DL GUI by Gloryness. This is a project I made and I'm very proud of it. 

This is a project I made with the youtube-dl module, where you can easily download videos and set the destination folder for it.

Unlike most GUI's, this has settings and options.

## Featuring:


* File Options (filename + more)
* Download Options (involving the download)
* Other Options (auth, restrictions, more)
* Settings (selenium settings for 'Detect URLs', general settings and config settings for .json)
* You can Install FFmpeg via the GUI.
* You can Update Youtube-DL via the GUI.
* Every input is built with .JSON input so whatever you do, stays right there. (if you want it to!)
* Jump to the Destination Folder easily

## How To Use / Download Exe (if you want)

It's simple, there is a download folder containing a .exe file which then contains all the folders and with a already converted exe file. After that, load it up and select your format and then click 'Done'. Enter the URL(s) on a new line each url, and then click 'Download'. You may also choose the option mid-download to 'Kill Operation'.
