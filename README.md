# Download-Videos
This is a project I made with the youtube-dl module, where you can easily download videos and set the destination folder for it. It's not perfect, but I'm going to be working more on it alot and converting to a Tkinter GUI :D!
This is a module you have to install, so you must do "pip install --upgrade youtube-dl" in the command line
