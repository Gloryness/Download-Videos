# Youtube-DL GUI
A Youtube-DL GUI by Gloryness. This is a project I made and I'm very proud of it. 

This is a project I made with the youtube-dl module, where you can easily download videos and set the destination folder for it.

Unlike most GUI's, this has settings and options.

Featuring:
* File Options (filename + more)
* Download Options (involving the download)
* Other Options (auth, restrictions, more)
