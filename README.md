## About the Project


A Youtube-DL GUI by Gloryness. This is a project I made and I'm very proud of it.

This is a project I made with the youtube-dl module, where you can easily download videos and set the destination folder for it.

Unlike most GUI's, this has settings and options.

## Featuring:


* The ability to download videos.
* The ability to install FFmpeg via the GUI.
* The ability to install any browser WebDriver via the GUI.
* The ability to update the whole GUI if it's outdated.
* The ability to config your own settings. [Selenium Settings, General Settings, Configuration Settings]
* The ability to change File Options with your video (title, description, subtitles, etc)
* The ability to change Download Options with your video (playlist, avonv/ffmpeg, ads, filesize, etc)
* The ability to change Other Options with your video (authentication, restrictions and more)
* The ability to browse videos in your own browser and instantly catch all URLs and insert into URL-BOX.

## How To Use / Download Exe (if you want)

- It's simple, there is a file named 'download.zip' and all you need to do is download it by clicking on it and using the Download option or just click the Download Link below.

- Now, here is the optional part. If you do not already have FFmpeg installed (or something simallar), then click the 'Tools' tab and click 'Install FFmpeg'. Here you can install FFmpeg via the GUI. Next you're going to have to put the FFmpeg folder somewhere, and set that as an environment variable on your PC.

- You can also install a WebDriver located in 'Tools' for the option 'Detect URLs' as that uses selenium.
NOTE: If you use Firefox, you can set your Firefox Profile in settings.
