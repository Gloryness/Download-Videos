# Youtube-DL GUI
A Youtube-DL GUI by Gloryness. This is a project I made and I'm very proud of it. 

This is a project I made with the youtube-dl module, where you can easily download videos and set the destination folder for it.

Unlike most GUI's, this has settings and options.

Featuring:
* File Options (filename + more)
* Download Options (involving the download)
* Other Options (auth, restrictions, more)
* Settings (selenium settings for 'Detect URLs', general settings and config settings for .json)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* You can Install FFmpeg via the GUI.
* You can Update Youtube-DL via the GUI.
* Jump to the Destination Folder easily
