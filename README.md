## About the Project


A Youtube-DL GUI by Gloryness. This is a project I made and I'm very proud of it. 

This is a project I made with the youtube-dl module, where you can easily download videos and set the destination folder for it.

Unlike most GUI's, this has settings and options.

## Featuring:


* File Options (filename + more)
* Download Options (involving the download)
* Other Options (auth, restrictions, more)
* Settings (selenium settings for 'Detect URLs', general settings and config settings for .json)
* You can Install FFmpeg via the GUI.
* You can Install any WebDriver via the GUI.
* Every input is built with .JSON input so whatever you do, stays right there. (if you want it to!)
* Jump to the Destination Folder easily

## How To Use / Download Exe (if you want)

- It's simple, there is a file named 'download.zip' and all you need to do is download it by clicking on it and using the Download option.

- Now, here is the optional part. If you do not already have FFmpeg installed (or something simallar), then click the 'Tools' tab and click 'Install FFmpeg'. Here you can install FFmpeg via the GUI. Next you're going to have to put the FFmpeg folder somewhere, and set that as an environment variable on your PC.

- You can also install a WebDriver located in 'Tools' for the option 'Detect URLs' as that uses selenium. NOTE: If you use Firefox, you can set your Firefox Profile in settings.
